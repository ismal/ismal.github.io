Welcome to my home page. Since February 2009 I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam of the Erasmus MC â€“ University Medical Center Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, conducting research on in-vivo molecular image analysis within European Network for Cell Imaging and Tracking Expertise (ENCITE) and Smart Optics Systems (SOS). Since 2011 I have been working on Adaptive bayesian multi-object tracking and motion analysis within my VENI grant. Since 2015 I am going to work on an in vitro high-throughput screening assay for novel microtubule active drugs within my Erasmus MC Fellowship. Since December 2018, I am an assistant professor at the department of Geoscience and Remote Sensing of TU Delft.
